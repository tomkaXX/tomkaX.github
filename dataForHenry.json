With an economy that is largely based on fishing, the locals are also used to seeing millions of fish die whenever the unpleasant scent fills the air. The smell and the fish die-off are caused by hydrogen sulfide erupting from decaying plants on the sea floor. On May 12, 2004, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured this image of a hydrogen sulfide eruption in progress.","dc.date":"2004-05-12","dc.date.x-metadatalastmodified":"2010-11-04","dc.publisher":"NASA Earth Observatory","dc.publisher.address":"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Contact/","dc.language":"en","dc.type":"Text.Article","dc.format":"text/html","dc.subject":"climate change, global climate change, global warming, natural hazards, Earth, environment, remote sensing, atmosphere, land processes, oceans, volcanoes, land cover, Earth science data, NASA, environmental processes, Blue Marble, global maps","thumbnail":"http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/13000/13155/Namibia_TMO2004133_tn.jpg"}],"cse_image":[{"src":"http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/13000/13155/Namibia_TMO2004133_tn.jpg","type":"1","width":"131","height":"96"}]}},{"kind":"customsearch#result","title":"Persistent Toxic Gas Eruptions Plague Waters off Namibian Coast ...","htmlTitle":"Persistent Toxic Gas <b>Eruptions</b> Plague Waters off <b>Namibian Coast</b> <b>...</b>","link":"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/persistent-toxic-gas-erup/","displayLink":"www.scientificamerican.com","snippet":"Feb 1, 2002 ...
